These are programs from the book "Basic Computer Games Microcomputer
Edition" by David H. Ahl, 1978.

They have been adapted where needed to run on the version of Microsoft
Basic used on the Ohio Scientific Superboard II computer, "OSI 6502
Basic version 1.0 rev 3.2."

Most games have instructions in the .txt file corresponding to the
.bas file for the game.

Porting Notes:

All programs have been tested on an Ohio Scientfic Superboard II with
8K of RAM.

The 24 column screen means that some output can be hard to read.

Banner.bas is not working. Need to review why.

Blackjack.bas will not run on a system with only 8K of RAM.
