This is a 6502 simulator to simulate an Ohio Scientific Superboard II
computer.

It is a work in progress. It is able to run the OSI Monitor and BASIC,
but is still pretty rough around the edges.

It is written in standard C++ and should be portable, but has only
been tested on Linux with the gcc compiler.
