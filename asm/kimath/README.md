This contains KIMATH and MATHPAC.

KIMATH is a library of floating-point math functions for the 6502
written by MOS Technology, originally for the KIM-1 platform. I have
ported it to the cc65 assembler.

MATHPAC is an extension program to KIMATH by John Eaton that was
originally published in issue 20 of Dr. Dobb's Journal. I have ported
it to the cc65 assembler and filled in some missing pieces needed to
get it to build and run on a KIM-1 (along with KIMATH).

Also included is an example application described in the KIMATH documentation.

All have been confirmed to run on a KIM-1 computer with 60K of RAM.

I obtained the original files from these locations:
